# Description

\newthought{The purpose of this analysis} is to explore the changes that have occurred in the flow of applications to Undergraduate Online Programs. I look at both application data from past census reports and inquiry data from prospective students who fill out Marketing inquiry forms that can be filled out from campaign landing pages.



    

# Findings


\newthought{FY20 saw an increase} in applications for students seeking online programs. After a one year period that started in Aug, 2018, marking a dearth of applications to the University's Undergraduate Online Programs, applications started coming in at a higher rate. This change is evident in the two plots below. 

The first shows that there has been growth in the last census year.

The second plot, shown below, captures the same data on a time line. The second period of activity, from August 2019, is significantly higher that the previous period. This is very exciting.

The final plot, shown below, marks the flow of marketing inquiry forms (as an initial referral source). What is clear is an increase in the flow of inquiries preceded the growth in applications.

# Conclusions

 
* While a small component of the University's portfolio of products, Online Programs have grown. 

* Further analysis into the the performance of ads for the online programs might show a similar trend.
