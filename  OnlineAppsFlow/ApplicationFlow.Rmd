# Basic Description

The purpose of this report is to look at the application flow for students who have matriculated into one of the University's Online Undergraduate Degree Programs. These programs are ever evolving and in order to meet applicant needs, we want to be attentive to their behavior and demographics.

```{r}
# Question that needs to be answered:
# 
# 1. Are the students in the original data  (51 records) all enrolled?
# 
# 1. In order to get application dates, this data set has to be merged with the SF database.
# 
# 1. Look in SF for online degree
```





# Findings


The raw data is all 2018/2019 online undergraduate net enrollees as of census 2019.

The data reveals a puzzling pattern. Beginning in September, 2018, no students applied. I have shared these findings with Jon Barker to get clarification. 


```{r}
SFData <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/SpecialProjects/FlowOfApps_OnlinePrograms/Data/SFData.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/SpecialProjects/FlowOfApps_OnlinePrograms/Data/rawData.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
```

**Where are the online students from?**

Most enrollees come from Maine, Cumberland, York, and Androscoggin counties. A county summary is shown below.

```{r}
kable(data %>% group_by(State, County) %>% summarise(n = n()))
```

**When do students apply?**

The following table summarizes how many applicants applied in each month. Notice the large gap from September 2018 through November, 2019. 

```{r}
Joined <- merge.data.frame(SFData, data, by.x = "ID", by.y = "ID")

Joined <- Joined %>% 
  filter(App.Application.Date!= "") %>% 
  mutate(App.Application.Date = as.Date(App.Application.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
  select(Last.Name.x, Email, Primary.City, Primary.State.Province, Student.Type, App.Application.Date) 

Joined <- Joined %>% 
  mutate(Month = as.yearmon(App.Application.Date))

Joined <- Joined %>% mutate(
  Mo = month(Month), 
  Yr = year(Month)) %>% 
  group_by(Month, Mo, Yr) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = n())

kable(Joined %>% select(Month, Apps))
# ggplot(Joined, aes(Mo, 
#                 Apps, group=Yr), colour=Yr)+
#   geom_line() +
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(x="Month", colour="Year") +
#   theme_classic()
# 
# ggplot(Joined, aes(x = factor(Mo), y = Apps, color = factor(Yr))) + geom_line()
```

The plot below illustrates the application flow. 

```{r}
dat1 = data.frame(date = seq(as.Date("2017-08-01"), as.Date("2020-02-01"), "1 month"))
dat1$date = as.yearmon(dat1$date)

colorPalette <- c("#323DA5", "#FFC13D", "#4595A4", "#C55A82" )
dat1$Apps <- c(1,0,0,4,4,4,5,9,5,7,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1)



dat2 <- dat1 %>% mutate(
  Mo = month(date), 
  Yr = year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date, Mo, Yr) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = sum(Apps))

the_plot <- ggplot(dat2, aes(x = date, y = Apps))+ geom_line(color = "blue")+ theme_bw()
the_plot

imgur_image <-
   add_imgur_image(
     image = the_plot,
     client_id = "851117406f0b457"

# ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Mo, y = Apps, group = factor(Yr), color = factor(Yr)))+ geom_line(size = 1.2) +theme_bw() +  scale_color_manual(values=colorPalette)  
#

# birthstimeseries <- ts(dat2$Apps, frequency=12, start=c(2017,8), end = 2020,2)

```


# Application Flow for Students who were no longer enrolled as of Census 2019

Because the sample of enrollees in online undergraduate programs is small, I thought it might broaden the sample to include applicants who did not enroll. However, this makes little difference. It appears that the data we are looking for, the cohort of students who will start this September, will not be available until Census. 

```{r}


newDatafromJon <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/SpecialProjects/FlowOfApps_OnlinePrograms/Data/OnlineAppFlow.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

Joined_2_AllApps <- merge.data.frame(SFData, newDatafromJon, by.x = "ID", by.y = "ID")

```

```{r newData part 2}

Joined_2_AllApps <- Joined_2_AllApps %>% 
  filter(App.Application.Date!= "") %>% 
  mutate(App.Application.Date = as.Date(App.Application.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
  select(Last.Name.x, Email, Primary.City, Primary.State.Province, Student.Type, App.Application.Date) 

Joined_2_AllApps <- Joined_2_AllApps %>% 
  mutate(Month = as.yearmon(App.Application.Date))

Joined_2_AllApps <- Joined_2_AllApps %>% mutate(
  Mo = month(Month), 
  Yr = year(Month)) %>% 
  group_by(Month, Mo, Yr) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = n())



datNew = data.frame(date = seq(as.Date("2017-08-01"), as.Date("2020-02-01"), "1 month"))
datNew$date = as.yearmon(datNew$date)

colorPalette <- c("#323DA5", "#FFC13D", "#4595A4", "#C55A82" )

datNew$Apps <- c(1,1,0,4,4,4,5,10,5,8,6,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1)


datNew2 <- datNew %>% 
  mutate(
  Mo = month(date), 
  Yr = year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date, Mo, Yr) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = sum(Apps))

the_plot_2 <- ggplot(datNew2, aes(x = date, y = Apps))+ geom_line(color = "blue")+ theme_bw()
the_plot_2

imgur_image <-
   add_imgur_image(
     image = the_plot_2,
     client_id = "851117406f0b457"
   )


```

# Conclusions


* The data provided raises many questions and opportunities for future exploration. 
  - We should look at application flow and demographics for students in online graduate programs as well. 
  - Do we want to look at the behavior of all students who have indicated an interest in online programs? There is an attribute in Salesforce, a check box for online interest in both Undergraduate and Graduate programs. A little over 3,000 students have indicated an interest. We can discuss this further. 
  
  - We cannot look at the application flow for graduate students in online programs because this student group is not defined.
