# Basic Description

The purpose of this report is to look at the application flow for students who have matriculated into one of the University's Online Undergraduate Degree Programs. These programs are ever evolving and in order to meet applicant needs, we want to be attentive to their timing, behavior and demographics. 

```{r}
# Question that needs to be answered:
# 
# 1. Are the students in the original data  (51 records) all enrolled?
# 
# 1. In order to get application dates, this data set has to be merged with the SF database.
# 
# 1. Look in SF for online degree
```





# Findings


The raw data is all 2018/2019 online undergraduate net enrolls as of Census 2019. The enrollment data comes from the Peoplesoft database.

Beginning in September 2018, it would appear no students applied to an Undergraduate Online Program. I shared these findings with Jon Barker to get clarification. The plot below highlights the limitations of the databases. Until Census 2020, when student enrollment status in an online program is confirmed, we will not have access to the application dates. Online programs are not officially captured in Salesforce. Until the next census report, we can only see the application flow for students who were enrolled prior to Fall 2019.    


```{r}
SFData <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/FY20 SpecialProjects/FlowOfApps_OnlinePrograms/Data/SFData.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

unique(dataUpdated$Group.Name)

**When do students apply?**

The following table summarizes how many applicants applied in each month. Again the large gap from September 2018 through November 2019 should be filled in at the next census report. 

```{r}
Joined <- merge.data.frame(SFData, data, by.x = "ID", by.y = "ID")

Joined <- Joined %>% 
  filter(App.Application.Date!= "") %>% 
  mutate(App.Application.Date = as.Date(App.Application.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
  select(Last.Name.x, Email, Primary.City, Primary.State.Province, Student.Type, App.Application.Date) 

Joined <- Joined %>% 
  mutate(Month = as.yearmon(App.Application.Date))

Joined <- Joined %>% mutate(
  Mo = month(Month), 
  Yr = year(Month)) %>% 
  group_by(Month, Mo, Yr) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = n())

Joined <- Joined %>% select(Month, Apps)
write.csv(Joined, "C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/FY20 SpecialProjects/FlowOfApps_OnlinePrograms/Data/LastYearData.csv", row.names = F)
# ggplot(Joined, aes(Mo, 
#                 Apps, group=Yr), colour=Yr)+
#   geom_line() +
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(x="Month", colour="Year") +
#   theme_classic()
# 
# ggplot(Joined, aes(x = factor(Mo), y = Apps, color = factor(Yr))) + geom_line()
```

The plot below illustrates the application flow. 

```{r}
dat1 = data.frame(date = seq(as.Date("2017-08-01"), as.Date("2020-02-01"), "1 month"))
dat1$date = as.yearmon(dat1$date)

colorPalette <- c("#323DA5", "#FFC13D", "#4595A4", "#C55A82" )
dat1$Apps <- c(1,0,0,4,4,4,5,9,5,7,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1)



dat2 <- dat1 %>% mutate(
  Mo = month(date), 
  Yr = year(date), 
  date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date
           ) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = sum(Apps))

```

**Where are the online students from?**

Most enrolls come from Maine, Cumberland, York, and Androscoggin counties. A county summary is shown below.

```{r}
kable(data %>% group_by(State, County) %>% summarise(n = n()))
```

**Application Flow for Students who were no longer enrolled as of Census 2019**

Because the sample of enrolls in online undergraduate programs is small, I thought it might broaden the sample to include applicants who did not enroll. However, this makes little difference. Most students who enrolled, have maintained their enrollment status.

```{r}


newDatafromJon <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/SpecialProjects/FlowOfApps_OnlinePrograms/Data/OnlineAppFlow.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

Joined_2_AllApps <- merge.data.frame(SFData, newDatafromJon, by.x = "ID", by.y = "ID")

```

```{r newData part 2}

Joined_2_AllApps <- Joined_2_AllApps %>% 
  filter(App.Application.Date!= "") %>% 
  mutate(App.Application.Date = as.Date(App.Application.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
  select(Last.Name.x, Email, Primary.City, Primary.State.Province, Student.Type, App.Application.Date) 

Joined_2_AllApps <- Joined_2_AllApps %>% 
  mutate(Month = as.yearmon(App.Application.Date))

Joined_2_AllApps <- Joined_2_AllApps %>% mutate(
  Mo = month(Month), 
  Yr = year(Month)) %>% 
  group_by(Month, Mo, Yr) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = n())



datNew = data.frame(date = seq(as.Date("2017-08-01"), as.Date("2020-02-01"), "1 month"))
datNew$date = as.yearmon(datNew$date)

colorPalette <- c("#323DA5", "#FFC13D", "#4595A4", "#C55A82" )

datNew$Apps <- c(1,1,0,4,4,4,5,10,5,8,6,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1)


datNew2 <- datNew %>% 
  mutate(
  Mo = month(date), 
  Yr = year(date),
  date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(Apps = sum(Apps))

the_plot_2 <- ggplot(datNew2, aes(x = date, y = Apps))+ geom_line(color = "blue")+ theme_bw() + 
      scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%m-%y") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
the_plot_2

imgur_image <-
   add_imgur_image(
     image = the_plot_2,
     client_id = "851117406f0b457"
   )

# Conclusions


* The data provided raises many questions and opportunities.

* We have access to the flow for undergraduate online programs for about one application cycle, September 2017-September 2018. Applications appear to trickle in throughout the year, peaking January-May.

* It should be noted that the application flow for Graduate Online programs is not captured in either Peoplesoft or Salesforce.

* The Data Governance Committee had set the coding of online programs as a high priority agenda item in March, 2018. No clear resolution has been put in place as of today.

* As of last census, most Online students were In-State, mainly Cumberland, York, and Androscoggin counties.

* Do we want to look at the behavior of all students who have indicated an interest in online programs? There is an attribute in Salesforce, a check box for online interest in both Undergraduate and Graduate programs. A little over 3,000 students have indicated an interest. However, according to Jon Barker, this is an unreliable method. We can discuss this further.
